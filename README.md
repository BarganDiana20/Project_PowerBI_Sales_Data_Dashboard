# Project_PowerBI_Sales_Data_Dashboard

## Overview:
I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI based on a dataset containing detailed invoice and sales records. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance across multiple dimensions, with a focus on time, geography, customer, and product segmentation.  

## Performed analyses and results:
+ ***Evolution of sales over time (2016â€“2018)***:  
  - August stands out as the month with the highest sales in each year analyzed, confirming a consistent seasonal pattern.
  - 2016 was the most active year in terms of total sales, with a significant sales volume.
  - In 2017, sales dropped by approximately 1.5M compared to the previous year, possibly due to changes in the commercial strategy.
  - In 2018, sales started to increase again, indicating a positive recovery and market consolidation.
