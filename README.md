# Project_PowerBI_Sales_Data_Dashboard

## Overview:
I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI based on a dataset containing detailed invoice and sales records. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance across multiple dimensions, with a focus on time, geography, customer, and product segmentation.  

## Performed analyses and results:
+ ***Evolution of sales over time (2016â€“2018)***:  
  - August stands out as the month with the highest sales in each year analyzed, confirming a consistent seasonal pattern.
  - 2016 was the most active year in terms of total sales, with a significant sales volume.
  - In 2017, sales dropped by approximately 1.5M compared to the previous year, possibly due to changes in the commercial strategy.
  - In 2018, sales started to increase again, indicating a positive recovery and market consolidation.
+ ***Key financial indicators - sales value with 19% VAT and average value per invoice***:  
  - Since the dataset had inconsistent VAT invoices values, I applied a fixed VAT rate of 19% to calculate the total value for each invoice with VAT.
  - KPI cards highlight:  
    + Total sales with 19% VAT amount to 10.11M, reflecting significant commercial activity.
    + The average invoice value with 19% VAT is 65.67K, indicating a strong average sales value. 
+ ***Sales distribution by product***:
  - The analysis of sales distribution by product shows that Product 5 generates the highest revenues, with a total of 5.2M, thus occupying the first place in the ranking.  
+ ***Sales distribution by county***:
